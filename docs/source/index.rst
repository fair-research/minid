   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Minid (Minimal Viable Identifier)
=================================


A minid (Minimal Viable Identifier) is an identifier that is sufficiently
simple to make creation and use trivial, while still having enough substance
to make data easily findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).


Requirements
------------

Minid 2.0.0 Requires Python 3.6 or higher.

Installation
------------

Minid Client 2.0.0 is avaialble on PyPI. You can install it with the following command::

  $ pip install minid


Alternatively, you can download the source code and install using setup tools::

  $ git clone https://github.com/fair-research/minid
  $ python setup.py install

Quick Start
-----------


.. Note::
    We are planning to replace the CLI with Click for the next release. We will take
    every measure to ensure backwards compatibility. However, there may be some
    differences in Beta 3 and Beta 4.


The CLI supports the following simple operations (Note: the `--test` flag creates names in a test namespace that is removed periodically; remove that flag to create production minids.):

* Login with Globus::

    $ minid login

* Create a new identifier::

    $ minid register --test [--title <title>] <file_name> [--locations <loc1>..<locN>]

* Retrieve metadata about a file::

    $ minid check <file_name>

* Retrieve metadata about an identifier::

    $ minid check <identifier>

* Update metadata about an identifier::

    $ minid update [--test] [--title <title>] [--locations <loc1> <loc2>] <identifier>

* Logout to clear credentials::

    $ minid logout

*  View all minid options::

    $ minid -h
